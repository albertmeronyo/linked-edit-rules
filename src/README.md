# QBsistent: an *obvious consistency* checker for RDF Data Cubes using Linked Edit Rules

**QBsistent** is a tool built on top of the [Stardog](http://www.stardog.com/) graph database that:

1. ingests Linked Edit Rules published on the Web as Linked Data,
2. updates its reasoning engine with such rules, and
3. generates reasoning-based consistency reports on user generated queries over arbitrary RDF Data Cubes.

The generated reports flag any incosistent data points with respect to the rules using the [Open Annotation Data Model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) and [PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/).
